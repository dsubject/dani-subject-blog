    Hi! I'm Danielle, but you can call me Dani. Welcome to my blog, Changing the
    Subject. I'm a writer, software developer and beekeeper (yup, you read that
    right) based out of Toronto.

    was on, and I made the switch into software development. To read more about
    my journey into coding, check out my blog post:
