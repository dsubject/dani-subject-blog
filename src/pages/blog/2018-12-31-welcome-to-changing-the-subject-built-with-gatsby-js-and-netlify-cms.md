_Changing the Subject_ is a project that is near and dear to my heart. The name is not just a pun on my last name, but also the name of a column I used to write at the Ontarion\_ \_— the place where I became a writer. It was there that I had my first byline published; there that I discovered my love for telling stories; and there that I made lifelong friends. 

If I could have stayed there forever I would have, but alas, student newspapers are there to give students opportunities and I eventually had to move on. 

My journey over the last four years has been one of both ups and downs. I completed my undergrad, moved to Toronto, got my first real “career” job, got laid off from that same job, went back to school, moved a lot, made a career change (RE: [A writer's journey into programming](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-writers-journey-into-programming-eb16198773a1)), rediscovered old passions and discovered new ones. During this time I also experienced loss, said goodbye to friends too soon, faced grief head on, and learned what it meant to live with a mental illness. To say the least, it’s been a rollercoaster of a ride, and I attribute my perseverance partly to myself (always give yourself credit) but mostly to the people I love. I couldn’t have done it without my friends, old and new, and I am forever grateful for you all. 

And here we are — or here I am. This blog will cover a variety of things, mostly beekeeping and web development, but you’ll also see stuff about music, comic books, maybe a few DIY posts, and mental health. It’s called _Changing the Subject_, after all. 

Thank you for stopping by and for reading — it means so much to me to be able to connect with others. We all know that social media has its downfalls, but if it weren’t for these platforms I wouldn’t have been able to connect with many of the incredible people I’ve met up until this point. I can’t wait to see what 2019 brings!

**IF YOU'RE HERE FOR THE TECH:**

I built this blog using Gatsby.js — a React-based static site generator, powered by GraphQL — and Netlify CMS. 

This wasn’t my first time using Gatsby to create a site, but it was my first time building a blog with it. Gatsby comes with “starters” or boilerplate sites that are maintained by open source, so to make things a little easier for myself I used the [gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/) starter. 

Netlify CMS allowed me to create a CMS (content management system) for my blog posts, rather than having to create markdown files every time I want to write one. Basically, Netlify allows you to edit your site’s content through your git repository via API, so each change you make to your content results in a commit. 

Netlify is honestly so easy to use it feels like I’m cheating. It took only a few minutes for me to map my domain and deploy my site. The only downfall is you need to pull from your git repo after making a change in your CMS, but I don’t even think that qualifies as a downfall. Command lines are fun.
